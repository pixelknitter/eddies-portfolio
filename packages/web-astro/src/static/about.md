## About

> A wizard is never late, nor is he early; he arrives precisely when he means to.

I am a world traveler, storyteller, forever learner, and wearer of many hats in 15+ years working in Silicon Valley startups. My passion is to inspire, nudge, and create a bit more optimism into the world.

## Interests

- Passionate about creating a better world with empowering technology
  - accessible GenAI
  - new mediums for interacting with technology
  - art + technology
- Connecting with others towards common growth
- Compelling stories either lived or created (worldly travels or storytelling)
- Sustainability and re-connecting in balance with the natural world
- Mental health and continuous education advocacy in policy, workplaces, and more
